## SESSION PLAN

### **Session Name** : Matplotlib: Data Visualization


**Learning Outcomes** 

- Build custom plots with Matplotlib and Pandas
- Catch trends, anomalies and patterns in data with visualizing data
- Know which plot is suitable for different types of data and use accordingly
- Learn about version control using Git and get acquainted with the coding standards for writing production-grade code.

**Prerequisites for the Student**

- Matplotlib: Data Visualization - Go through the concept and solve the tasks and assessments.


**Student Activities**


- Discuss with the Mentor what you have learned.

- Overview of Data Visualization with Matplotlib
  - Stacked Bar Chart
  - Histogram
  - Scatter Plot
  - Drawing Multiple Plots
- Learn about version control and get acquainted with using Git for creating and making changes in a repository on GitHub.
- Get to learn about the importance of coding standards in Python such as PEP8, PEP257 also learn to implement them.

- Code Walkthrough (refer the GitHub repo [Code Walkthrough](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/tree/master/Sprint%203%20Data%20Visualization%20and%20Guided%20Hackathon/3.1%20-%20Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib/Code%20Walkthrough))
- Questions and Discussion on doubts - AMA
- Team Activity - It is ok to be wrong and the whole point of the activity is to make you think. You will have to fill a google form as part of the activity with your answers. (Refer the GitHub repo to see the [Activity](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/blob/master/Sprint%203%20Data%20Visualization%20and%20Guided%20Hackathon/3.1%20-%20Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib/Activity/Activity%20-%20Extracting%20Insights%20from%20Graphs.md))


**Next Session**

- Importance of attempting hackathons and how they help in developing skills.
- The problem can be quite difficult compared to the assignments and projects that they have seen until now.
