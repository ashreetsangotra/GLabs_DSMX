## SESSION PLAN

### **Session name**  : Manipulating Data using NumPy

**Learning Outcomes**

The concept will introduce how to manipulate matrices using the NumPy library in Python. Matrices are fundamental representations of data for many machine learning applications. In this concept, you will learn :
- Arrays in NumPy
- Creating NumPy arrays
- Indexing and Slicing NumPy arrays
- Applying NumPy hands-on

**Prerequisites for the Student**

- Manipulating Data using NumPy  - Go through the concept and solve the tasks and assessments.



**Student Activities**

- Discuss with the Mentor what you have learned.
- Overview of Manipulating Data using NumPy
- What are Arrays?
- Indexing and Slicing
- Vectorization(Operations with Numpy array) & Broadcasting
- Different Ways to Create Numpy Arrays like one dimensional, two dimensional, an identity matrix.
- Perform Operations on Weather Dataset.
- Practice problems on Arrays, Indexing and Slicing, Vectorization and Broadcasting.
- Code Walkthrough (refer github repo for [code Walkthorugh](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/tree/master/Sprint%202%20NumPy%20and%20Pandas/2.1%20Manipulating%20Data%20Using%20Numpy/Code%20Walkthrough))
- Questions and Discussion on doubts - AMA 
- Team Activity - It is ok to be wrong and the whole point of the activity is to make you think. You will have to fill a google form as part of the activity with your answers. (Refer the GitHub repo to see the [Activity](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/tree/master/Sprint%202%20NumPy%20and%20Pandas/2.1%20Manipulating%20Data%20Using%20Numpy/Activity))

**Next Session**

- Concept - Data Wrangling with Pandas
- Key topics to be highlighted - highlight where they would need to spend more time and importance w.r.t Data Science. 
    - Series and Dataframes
    - Access data in Dataframes
    - Basic operations on Dataframes
    - Advanced operations on Dataframes
